Various experimental psychological research projects I've worked on

About The Author: I am currently a psychology Ph.D. student in the University of California system. In my primary research lab, I focus on investigating moral decision making, ideology, and emotion.  In my secondary lab, I study the intersection of media and collective trauma in the aftermath of terrorism and natural disasters.  While I have experience coding in Matlab, R, Python, and various statistical programs, I enjoy exploring and learning more about new analytical/ statistical techniques, neuroscience and psychophysiological methods, and deep learning and artifical intelligence.
